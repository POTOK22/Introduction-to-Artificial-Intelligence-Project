# Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence-Project

## Introduction
With increasing life expentency worldwide the problem of heart diseases has become a major and progressive challange to deal with. Since the likelihood of developing heart diseases can be estimated from various health parameters the question is how to do it precisely and accurately. The goal of this project is to create a simple but effective program that can predict and identify patients risk of developing a heart diesese in the future.

## Description of the Real-World Problem

### Goal
The primary objective of developing this program is to accrately predict the patients likelihood of developing a heart disease based on the various health-related factors and paramteres. In simple terms, the program should accept specific amount of patient records, process the provided data and give the the reliable prediction as an outcome.

### Motivation
Improving health outcomes and extending human longevity represent fundamental goals in medice and must be recognized as highly valuable and important endevaours. Additionally this project may contribute to a better understanding of the key factors that are the most influential and strongly correlate with human health and cardiovascular system.

### Input data
The data which will be the input for this program is from a .csv file containg several key health factors that might influence the probability of develeoping the hearth disease in the future. There will be some basic parameters like age or sex, but of course there will be also more specific medical criterions eg. choresterol level, resting blood pressure or fasting blood sugar value.
